# Drag
IT4001 Final Project

For this project, I made a simple game called "Drag". 

Player will see the launch screen with a dot in the center. 
After click the dot, game will start and plenty of blocks will move forward to the dot.
To suvive in the game, player should move the dot by click in the blank space in order to avoid the attack from blocks.
